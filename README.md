# EvolutionSimulator

I just finished my first Java Project, that simulates the animal population

Project Description can be found at: 
https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/lab8

The main class is located at src/main/visualizerMain

How to use my application?

At any time you can click the "start" button, which starts/stop the ongoing simulation.
Also you can click "show dom genotype" button, which colors orange all the animals that have the most
common genotype among all of them.
You can unclick these buttons at any time as well.

When paused, you can click at any animal to show his current stats. Then you can click a button, to follow this
animal (it gets colored cyan), his children(violet) and his children-children, etc.(diferent shades of blue).
To stop following these animals, unclick the button or click any other followed animal and do the same.

Simulation takes input from file parameters.json
and can save statistics to files stats1.txt and stats2.txt
